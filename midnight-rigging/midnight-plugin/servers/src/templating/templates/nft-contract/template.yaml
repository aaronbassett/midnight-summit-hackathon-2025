longDescription: |
  A complete NFT smart contract implementation for pod network with a Rust CLI.

  This template creates a production-ready NFT project that includes:
  - Solidity smart contract with minting, transferring, and metadata functionality
  - requireQuorum integration for secure ownership verification
  - Rust CLI application for contract interaction (mint, transfer, query)
  - Event streaming with cryptographic verification
  - Pod SDK integration for seamless network interaction

  The contract follows pod network patterns and includes all necessary tooling
  for deploying and interacting with NFTs on the pod network blockchain.

useCases:
  - Creating simple NFT collections on pod network
  - Learning pod network smart contract development patterns
  - Building CLI tools for NFT contract interaction
  - Prototyping NFT projects with verified event streaming
  - Integrating Pod SDK into Rust applications

structure:
  overview: |
    Creates a Rust workspace with an embedded Solidity NFT contract. The CLI
    handles minting, transferring, querying token URIs, and watching verified
    events emitted by the contract.

    The project structure follows Rust and pod network conventions:
    - Root level: Cargo.toml workspace with Pod SDK dependencies
    - Solidity contract: Top-level .sol file using pod's requireQuorum
    - Rust source: src/ directory with CLI and contract interaction logic
    - Documentation: README.md with complete setup and usage instructions

  keyFiles:
    - path: '{{contract_name}}.sol'
      purpose: |
        Main NFT contract with mint, transfer, and tokenURI functions.
        Uses Pod's requireQuorum for secure ownership verification.
        Customize: Add burning functionality, supply limits, or access controls.

    - path: 'src/main.rs'
      purpose: |
        CLI entry point with subcommands for mint, transfer, get-token-uri, and watch.
        Uses clap for argument parsing and pod-sdk for contract interaction.
        Customize: Add new commands (burn, batch mint), modify default values.

    - path: 'Cargo.toml'
      purpose: |
        Rust project manifest with pod-sdk and pod-types dependencies.
        Customize: Add additional crates for extended functionality.

    - path: 'README.md'
      purpose: |
        Project documentation with setup instructions and usage examples.
        Customize: Add project-specific deployment notes and examples.

  commonCustomizations:
    - 'Add burn() function to allow NFT destruction'
    - 'Implement max supply limit in mint() function'
    - 'Add access control for minting (whitelist, roles)'
    - 'Extend CLI with batch minting capabilities'
    - 'Add transfer approval mechanism'
    - 'Implement token enumeration functions'

  nextSteps:
    - "Run 'cargo build' to compile the project"
    - 'Deploy the contract to pod network and note the contract address'
    - 'Update the default contract address in main.rs or pass via --contract-address'
    - "Run 'cargo run -- mint <token_id> <uri>' to mint your first NFT"
    - "Run 'cargo run -- watch' to stream verified Minted events"
    - 'Check README.md for complete usage examples'
