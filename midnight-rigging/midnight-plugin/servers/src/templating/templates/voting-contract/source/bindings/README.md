# {{contract_name}} Bindings

**Generated by**: {{TEMPLATE_NAME}} v{{TEMPLATE_VERSION}}
**Date**: {{CURRENT_DATE}}

This directory contains auto-generated Rust bindings for the {{contract_name}} smart contract.

## Auto-Generation

The `src/` directory in this crate is **automatically generated** by running:

```bash
cd ../contract
make generate
```

This uses Foundry's `forge bind` command to create type-safe Rust bindings from the compiled Solidity contract.

## Usage

This crate is used as a dependency by the `{{client_crate_name}}` CLI application. It provides:

- Contract ABI bindings
- Type-safe function call builders
- Event decoding utilities
- Alloy integration for contract interaction

## Do Not Edit

⚠️ **Warning**: Files in the `src/` directory are auto-generated and will be overwritten when you run `make generate` in the contract directory. Do not manually edit these files.

## Regenerating Bindings

If you modify the {{contract_name}}.sol contract, you must regenerate the bindings:

1. Build the contract: `cd ../contract && forge build`
2. Generate bindings: `make generate`
3. Rebuild the client: `cd ../client && cargo build`
