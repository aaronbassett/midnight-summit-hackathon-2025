longDescription: |
  A simple voting contract for pod network using AddressSet and SharedCounter.

  This template creates a standalone voting contract that includes:
  - AddressSet for tracking voters
  - SharedCounter for vote tallies
  - Time-based voting periods with pod time utilities
  - Idempotent voting logic (prevents double voting)
  - Finalization with results

  Perfect for DAO governance, proposals, community decisions, and polls.

useCases:
  - DAO governance and proposal voting
  - Community decisions
  - Polls and surveys
  - Time-bounded participation

requiredVariables:
  - name: contract_name
    description: Name of the contract class (e.g., "ProposalVote", "DAOVoting")
  - name: proposal_description
    description: Proposal description (e.g., "Should we upgrade the protocol?")
  - name: voting_duration
    description: Voting duration in seconds (e.g., "604800" for 7 days)

  overview: |
    Creates a standalone voting contract using AddressSet and SharedCounter.

    The contract includes:
    - AddressSet for voter registration
    - SharedCounter for yes/no vote tallies
    - Time utilities (requireTimeAfter/Before) for voting period
    - Idempotent voting logic
    - Finalization function for determining results

    Uses pod SDK FastTypes and time utilities for correct behavior.

      purpose: |
        Main voting contract with AddressSet and SharedCounter.
        Includes vote casting, finalization, and result queries.
        Customize: Add weighted voting, multiple choice, or quorum requirements.

  commonCustomizations:
    - 'Add weighted voting with token balance'
    - 'Implement multiple choice voting'
    - 'Add quorum requirements'
    - 'Implement token-gated voting'
    - 'Add delegation support'

  nextSteps:
    - "Run 'forge install podnetwork/pod-sdk' to install dependencies"
    - 'Compile the contract with your Solidity compiler'
    - 'Deploy with constructor parameters (description, duration)'
    - 'Users call vote(bool support) during voting period'
    - 'Call finalize() after voting ends to determine result'
