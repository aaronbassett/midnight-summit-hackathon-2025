longDescription: |
  A complete fungible token smart contract implementation for pod network with Rust CLI and Foundry tooling.

  This template creates a production-ready token project that includes:
  - Solidity smart contract with ERC-20-like interface (balanceOf, transfer)
  - requireQuorum integration for secure balance verification
  - Rust CLI application for contract interaction (balance queries, transfers, event watching)
  - Foundry configuration for contract compilation and testing
  - Event streaming with cryptographic verification
  - Pod SDK integration for seamless network interaction

  The contract follows standard token patterns and includes all necessary tooling
  for deploying and interacting with fungible tokens on the pod network blockchain.

useCases:
  - Creating fungible token contracts on pod network
  - Learning pod network smart contract development with Foundry
  - Building CLI tools for token contract interaction
  - Prototyping token projects with verified event streaming
  - Integrating Pod SDK with Foundry-based projects

structure:
  overview: |
    Creates a hybrid Rust/Foundry workspace with a Solidity token contract. The CLI
    handles balance queries, token transfers, and watching verified Transfer events
    emitted by the contract.

    The project structure combines Rust and Foundry conventions:
    - Root level: Cargo.toml for Rust workspace, foundry.toml for Solidity config
    - Solidity contracts: contracts/ directory with .sol files using pod's requireQuorum
    - Rust source: src/ directory with CLI and contract interaction logic
    - Foundry artifacts: lib/ for dependencies, out/ for compiled contracts
    - Documentation: README.md with complete setup and usage instructions

  keyFiles:
    - path: 'contracts/{{contract_name}}.sol'
      purpose: |
        Main token contract with constructor parameters, balanceOf, and transfer functions.
        Uses pod's requireQuorum for secure balance verification on transfers.
        Customize: Add approval mechanisms, minting/burning, or additional token features.

    - path: 'src/main.rs'
      purpose: |
        CLI entry point with subcommands for get-balance, transfer-token, and watch.
        Uses clap for argument parsing and pod-sdk for contract interaction.
        Customize: Add new commands (approve, mint, burn), modify default values.

    - path: 'foundry.toml'
      purpose: |
        Foundry configuration for Solidity compilation and testing.
        Customize: Adjust Solidity compiler version, add test configurations, modify paths.

    - path: 'Cargo.toml'
      purpose: |
        Rust project manifest with pod-sdk and pod-types dependencies.
        Customize: Add additional crates for extended functionality.

    - path: 'README.md'
      purpose: |
        Project documentation with setup instructions including Foundry installation.
        Customize: Add project-specific deployment notes and token economics details.

  commonCustomizations:
    - 'Add approve() and transferFrom() for ERC-20 compatibility'
    - 'Implement mint() and burn() functions for supply management'
    - 'Add access control for privileged operations (owner, minter roles)'
    - 'Extend CLI with approval and allowance commands'
    - 'Add token metadata functions (decimals, totalSupply view)'
    - 'Implement Foundry tests in test/ directory'

  nextSteps:
    - "Run 'forge install podnetwork/pod-sdk' to install Solidity dependencies"
    - "Run 'forge build' to compile the Solidity contract"
    - 'Deploy the contract with constructor parameters (tokenName, tokenSymbol, initialSupply)'
    - 'Update the default contract address in main.rs or pass via --contract-address'
    - "Run 'cargo build' to compile the Rust CLI"
    - "Run 'cargo run -- get-balance <address>' to query token balances"
    - "Run 'cargo run -- watch' to stream verified Transfer events"
    - 'Check README.md for complete usage examples'
