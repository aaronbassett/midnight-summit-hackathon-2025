longDescription: |
  An ERC20-style fungible token contract for pod network using Balance FastType for safe transfers.

  This template creates a standalone token contract that includes:
  - Balance FastType for order-independent balance management
  - SharedCounter for total supply tracking
  - Transfer, mint, and burn functions
  - Allowance system for approved spenders
  - Supply cap support (optional)

  The contract follows ERC20 patterns and uses pod network FastTypes to ensure
  correct behavior in the coordination-free execution model.

useCases:
  - Creating fungible tokens (currencies, points, credits)
  - Need ERC20-compatible interface
  - Want safe balance management with order-independent execution

  overview: |
    Creates a standalone ERC20-style token contract using Balance FastType.

    The contract includes:
    - Balance FastType for safe, order-independent transfers
    - SharedCounter for total supply
    - Mint, burn, transfer, and approval functions
    - Supply cap enforcement (if max_supply > 0)

    Uses pod SDK FastTypes to ensure correct behavior regardless of transaction order.

      purpose: |
        Main token contract with Balance FastType for balances and SharedCounter for supply.
        Includes transfer, mint, burn, and allowance functions.
        Customize: Add transfer fees, pausable functionality, or time-locked minting.

  commonCustomizations:
    - 'Add transfer fees (percentage of transfer amount)'
    - 'Implement pausable functionality for emergency stops'
    - 'Add time-locked minting with requireTimeBefore'
    - 'Implement role-based access control for minting'
    - 'Add snapshot functionality for governance'

  nextSteps:
    - "Run 'forge install podnetwork/pod-sdk' to install dependencies"
    - 'Compile the contract with your Solidity compiler'
    - 'Deploy with constructor parameters (name, symbol, decimals, maxSupply)'
    - 'Call mint() to create initial token supply'
    - 'Test transfers to verify Balance FastType behavior'
