longDescription: |
  A minimal starter template for pod network smart contracts with basic structure and FastTypes example.

  This template creates a simple contract that includes:
  - SharedCounter FastType example for order-independent operations
  - Owner management pattern
  - Event emissions for state changes
  - Basic structure ready for customization

  Perfect for learning pod network development or starting a custom contract from scratch.
  Remove the example counter and add your own business logic using FastTypes.

useCases:
  - Starting a new smart contract from scratch
  - Learning pod network FastTypes and contract structure
  - Prototyping custom contract logic
  - Creating a minimal boilerplate for pod network

  - name: contract_name

structure:
  overview: |
    Creates a minimal Solidity contract with pod SDK imports and basic structure.

    The contract includes:
    - SharedCounter example showing FastType usage
    - Owner management with transferOwnership
    - Event emissions for tracking state changes
    - Modifiers for access control

    This is your starting point - customize by replacing the counter with your own
    state variables and business logic.

      purpose: |
        Main contract file with minimal boilerplate and SharedCounter example.
        Uses pod SDK for FastTypes to ensure order-independent execution.
        Customize: Replace counter with your state variables and add custom functions.

  commonCustomizations:
    - 'Replace SharedCounter with Balance, OwnedCounter, or AddressSet based on needs'
    - 'Add custom business logic functions using FastTypes'
    - 'Implement time-based logic with requireTimeAfter/Before utilities'
    - 'Add custom events for important state changes'
    - 'Extend access control with role-based permissions'

  nextSteps:
    - 'Customize the contract by replacing the example counter'
    - 'Add your business logic using FastTypes for order-independent operations'
    - 'Add events for state changes you want to track'
    - 'Test your contract for commutativity (operations work in any order)'
    - 'Deploy to pod network and verify finality via attestations'
